Prior to the SN, there was increased in situ biosphere modification of earth to decrease global warming, reducing a variety of greenhouse gases not limited to human-made. This was done instead of tapering down human production of greenhouse gases, and actually accelerated our output (which accelerated the modification). When the SN occurred, greenhouse gas production practically halted, while the modifications continued to reduce all greenhouse gases. Some weird form of neo-imperialism crystalized within the UN that consisted of large security forces, primarily from the US, that ensured nominally free elections within countries and attempted to ensure fast economic growth. This global society and philosophy also looked down upon population control as restricting liberties -- just one of the liberties they tried to protect, but this brought massive population growth. 

For the first days or so of the SN, the earth heated by a significant amount and radiation started to drastically effect biological life. This releases more water vapor into the air and somewhat dries out the earth.

After the first days, a significant amount of clouds appear and lightning strikes rake the earth, causing wild fires exacerbated from the increased dryness. The fires may also increase the temperature of earth temporarily.

This will cause massive social unrest and economic disaster, which will cause production to slow down, which will cause greenhouse gases to slow down. However, as said before, the greenhouse gas scrubbing will continue. This combined with increased 1. cloud cover from increased nucleation points and water vapor, 2. the heating effects reducing, and 3. PAR decrease will result in rapid global cooling. The deposition of snow will accelerate this effect, along with whatever normal compounding stuff results in ice ages. 

The amount of bit flips dramatically increases, causing computers to be significantly more unstable from cosmic rays. Furthermore (and more importantly), secondary radiation causes even more and most computers become useless and virtually irrecoverable. Most computers have major damage and start to totally fail, causing massive damage. 

The first month is still marked by increased temperature and wild fires, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure.

Virtually all travel via planes is halted. Bit flips in aircrafts are unacceptable, radiation is significantly higher, and weather is extreme. Travel and transport via ships also quickly diminishes. Weather on the seas becomes severe and electronics start rapidly malfunctioning. Even if the ships are able to transport goods, they have little to no certainty of who (if anyone) will be receiving the cargo on the other side. This combined with lack of communication lets the ships halt most transportation besides the most critical of goods at short distances.

At first, there is a unified response. Projects in cities start to strengthen existing buildings to resist the increased radiation and reduce fire risks, rural areas are sent information on how to safeguard themselves with assistance from the government, and severely affected areas are evacuated. There is re-tooling of industry to produce required materials for the effort. The break-down of trade, communication, and production are severe, but new methods are created and innovative solutions are created and start to be put in place to deal with the effects from the SN.

However, to fulfill the needs of all people, governments have to strain their resources. Corruption in doesn't change in most governments and benevolent governments remain so. However, all governments are unable to provide their citizens with what is needed. Collapse of long range, fast travel of information starts to polarize people and rumors spread. It takes very little time for almost all countries to totally fragment. Collapse of information and travel affects major urban centers less, and thus central governments are still able to control them effectively. Furthermore, central governments at this stage could care less about people that do not want help. 

Countries like Russia almost immediately collapse, with the leadership accepting the fact and consolidating power in central locations while they pragmatically find the best way to keep their country intact while the well-being of the civilian population at large is secondary. Break away regions follow the model of the host nation. Wars are the most prevalent in the break away regions.

China is largely able to continue to have central governance. There are waves of uprisings and the people in power are churned and rotated, but their communalism and primary desire for their country and people to come out of this alive is paramount, and the propaganda feeds this, and the people largely embrace it. The uprisings and upheaval in the government is always in the name of the survival and strength of a greater society. It is the apotome of realpolitik. The conventional ways wars and upheaval of China are continued (I.E. "It's time for a new order"), but with the survival of the nation at stake, it is extremely accelerated.

Europe's countries fragment into regional sectors, but still nominally under control of the countries' governments. 

The USA is like Europe for each state, while the federal government is transforms into a supporting and interconnecting role for the states. Regional areas are much more self-sufficient due to the increased crime rates within the US, increased individualism, dispersion, and of course the huge increase in guns per capita. 

Most of sub-Saharan Africa has the same problems as Russia, while north Africa is a mix between Europe and Russia. Central Asia is more like Russia, while other Asian nations are more like north Africa. Latin America is like north Africa as well.

After the first month, harvests severely diminish from global warming and radiation. This isn't the biggest food problem, though. Rural areas have the worst protection against the effects. Crop fields and store houses are hit hard by wild fires. A lot of electronical tractors are operational. Agricultural workers have the hardest time protecting against radiation. Even with the food they have, most food has to be imported to areas that need it. Traversing long distances is very difficult, it is hard to coordinate the deliveries, and the agricultural centers don't want to give away their food. Furthermore, rural areas are the hardest to get to and control, so they are likely to fragment. 

The projects to save people from the effects of the SN are conducive to urban, small areas. This is in opposition for the need for food. People would first flee to urban areas, which will become over crowded without even the ability to shield them from radiation and the effects of the SN. This will cause massive problems.

The weather starts to flip in the other direction for aforementioned reasons, but most if not all people understand that it the climate is going to get worse, but not better. Decentralized bands that were fragmented from their former country start to raid agricultural areas for food. Some countries are able to use their militaries to defend these centers. This depends on if their military composition has weapons and armor that wouldn't be heavily irradiated, if the military would desert, and pure strength-area ratio. Areas that don't have adequate protection are very likely to form their own governments to protect themselves. 

Even fragmented areas, however, still are nominally part of the same global initiative to survive the event. This means that most regional areas still implement measures to survive and are nominally part of the same system.

The electrical grid largely stops functioning, with energy availability being extremely localized.

All governances start massive underground works with in situ food production. 

With time, however, fragmentation gets worse. Whether it be via raiders, fires, radiation, starvation, polarization, etc even regional centers see fragmentation, emigration, refugee crises, uprisingings, coups, and banditry in varying degrees. These effects only serve to exacerbate the problem, which exacerbates the effects. Central governments collapse due to a series refugee crises and starvation without the ability to cope long-term. Regional governances will take longer to collapse, but they will from instability, raiding and lack of ability to protect against the elements.

The matter of fact is that there is simply too many people and a majority of them are not going to be able to survive due to the collapse of productivity and agriculture. But people don't roll over and die, instead the people that are starving turn to raiding and wars to get the resources they need. This is further justified by distrust in all other groups and a perceived hording of resources which is primarily caused by a break down in communication. Distrust fuels distrust and this problem gets worse and worse. 

Within a few months, society devolves into relatively small groups of people. The only surviving form of governance is a type of regional allegiance where these groups still look out for one another and trade. The break down of society and the raiding and wars cause recovery from this disaster basically impossible. The only exceptions to this rule is the occasional rump state that is able to transition to a well functioning fear based society. Countries that have an authoritarian, communal (in the sense that their priorities are with the greater state or social structure), and fear based societies have a higher likelihood of being able to pull this off. Russia is one of these states and is able hold onto power. Moscow is probably unsustainable for several reasons, so the government (or a new one) is able to set up headquarters in southern Russia. The state would be small, but with the pre-existing resources that were available to it, it is able to maintain some form of stability and continuity.

Within a few months, the climate takes a full 180. This is not helped by the fact that the northern hemisphere is going into winter. Wild fires have caused untold damage across the globe. Any uninhabited areas have most buildings, infrastructure, and other man-made objects destroyed. This is due to the rapid temperature fluctuations (day to day from climate instability and the broader shift from hot to cold), wild fires, increased rainfall, the rain that turns into ice, then increased snowfall, extreme fungal growth, and lightning strikes.

From a few months to a year, most of the human population of the world has died. The remaining survivors are nested in secured bunkers under ground running off of whatever power they are able to secure. Some use wind power, while most use some kind of fossil fuels that they have stock piled and periodically scavenge for. If a bunker is near a coal plant or a coal mine, they use coal and gasoline. If a bunker is in a city, they primarily use gasoline. If a bunker is near renewable energy, they use that and gasoline. Fossil fuels would serve a dual purpose of heating and producing energy. Most of the generators within these bunkers are as efficient as possible by design. This means that they are turning steam turbines. There may be some petroleum extraction and refining.

After years of this new order, people practically forget the old order. As said before, the new reality simply was incompatible with the old way of living. This also includes the social order. Some retrain a concept of loyalty to an overarching country or structure, but only as an abstract idea. It is hard for me to really determine how other nations than the US would precisely function, so the story is going to have to take place in the US or long enough after the event to where pre-existing things are irrelevant. For the time being, I'm going with the south-east of the US. For now I'm going to choose Atlanta as an example. However, the names of the city or even region isn't going to be disclosed at all.

### Day 1
Conventional panic starts to kick in. It only takes minutes for the SN to be confirmed within the scientific community that would know. It takes a few more minutes for the news and governments to start disseminating the information to the public, along with general advice like get to the lowest area possible, stay indoors, etc. People near stores that have food or essentials start to stock up as much as possible, while the workers start to desert their posts to get to more favorable areas. Ambivalence of the workers and desire to flee leads to uncontested peaceful "looting" of stores, with partial equality of distribution of goods. This varies store to store, though. Filling up bathtubs with water is commonplace, and causes a dip in the water pressure, but the public is urged not to panic. Electronics outside or without much neutron protection start to fail within the first few hours, but it will take longer for a substantial part of the population to loose the ability to communicate. Muons will be a huge problem to all devices, insulated or not.

The temperature of earth significantly increases. This makes it difficult stay outside for prolonged periods of time. This also places a greater strain on the power grid.

Advisories on how to protect electronic communication equipment is disseminated, and radios are disseminated to those who do not have them. Cars with substantial amounts of aluminum exposed are disposed of, and quick work around are attempted. In addition to this, the government attempts to requisition or buy vehicles with preferable qualities with enough success that they are able to continue critical tasks.   

Civilians with non-critical jobs hunker down and plan for the worst. Health care workers and volunteers continue their jobs and work to protect the hospital against radiation. Police officers do not respond to the looting of stores, but focus on quelling any violence and working as volunteers to protect the public in whatever capacity is needed. Government administration is hit very hard and they call in specialists and experts in fields to solve the myriad of problems. 

### Day 2
There is wide spread call-outs of work, including managers and executives. The government focus on the most critical jobs and puts measures in place to protect those workers. This is combined with an effort to motive people to go into those jobs, like propaganda and increased pay. 

A combination of local/grassroots and government initiatives are set up to decrease the harm from the radiation. This consists primarily of scrapping and sourcing cheap, dense materials to throw onto structures. The top floor(s) of buildings are evacuated due to risk from concrete and iron radiation. However, there is still a fair bit of radiation that comes from radiation from all sides due to the nature of neutrons, so people that can stay away from the sides of buildings do. The problem with all of these measures is that more material only pushes the envelope of thermal neutrons into higher energies. This *does* decrease the amount of radiation, but this depends on cross section relative to energy levels and neutron differences at the air density. It probably decreases the radiation by at least 90%, though. Additionally, concrete will have a relatively high amount of radiation, but there will be less radiation that reaches it due to the tall buildings. Due to this, it is advised that people don't stay outside in cities for too long. People that do go outside attempt to wear protective clothing, but the heat makes it very difficult.

Radiation surveys start to take place to section off areas with high radiation and advise people to evacuate from houses/apartments that have unacceptable radiation. This is combined with rough estimates of radiation in certain places to help coordinate these efforts. 

Money starts to become a complicated issue. Supply shrinks for most products as supply chains and production slows down and peaceful & morally dubious looting has stripped stores of their supplies. However by this day, panic has decreased and efforts to re-establish stability are put in place. These stores don't raise prices and put limits on how many goods per person are bought. The same thing happens in all stores, but specifically the ones selling supplies that people actually care about at this time. Money starts to become irrelevant as the determining factor in getting what you need is based on how much you are allotted + time. Those who cannot afford essentials are granted relief from the government, charities, and businesses. The only place where money actually matters at all is the black/underground market. The underground market's prices are extremely high due to decreased supply, increased demand, and the fact that people are spending more money than ever to get their supplies before they run out.

Government/administrations start plans to use whatever underground areas are available to them to house people in an area safe from radiation.

Electronics start to become abandoned besides for radios, as the global internet system falters. Radio stations are set up to broadcast news, updates, and advice on how to survive.

A lot of satellites are either malfunctioning or totally non-functional. GPS and satellite imagery are effectively non-functional.

### Day 3-7
The previous processes continue. Essential jobs are continued, but non-critical production is practically halted. The power grid starts rationing power. Some non-critical production is shut off the power grid, while brownouts occur across everything except essential production. Wild fires make travel more difficult and a small percentage of communities are evacuated due to these fires. Agricultural centers are hit hard by the fires. 

Essential workers are given high priority to SN mitigation, while civilians are advised to remain within their houses as deep as possible. People start to disperse to have residence in places less prone to radiation.

Little to no effects from the radiation are seen yet. The amount of radiation being absorbed will take significant time to have any meaningful effects. At this point in time, the concern of people from the radiation is having a higher effect than the radiation itself. Additionally, UVB radiation will take like 6-12 months to increase to full extent, but people are able to wear enough clothing and sunscreen to where this is not a problem.

Cloud cover starts to increase and lightning strikes start to rake the earth. The effectiveness of fire-fighting is severely diminished, with the goals of fire-fighters being relegated to containing the fires outside of communities and major road ways.

Decentralization rapidly increases as travel becomes extremely difficult and local solutions have to be made. The federal government quickly becomes an advisory body. Atlanta and Savannah become centers of Georgian administration, with every county forming their own specific responses to the problems. There pull system in the state for getting resources (counties ask the state for resources). A tier system is introduced country-wide to designate priority of centers and outline what processes should be undertaken. Atlanta and Savannah are T1. Macon, Brunswick, Dublin, Tifton, Athens, Dalton, and Carrollton are T2. All counties are T3. T3 has a T2 center and T2 centers have a T1 center. There are TX$_1$.X$_2$ (I.E T1.0 for Atlanta proper) areas that designate subdivisions of the area. There are many cities on the outskirts of Atlanta proper which would be designated these subdivisions. 

Most T3s and all T2/1s have radio stations. All T1s have started pushing non-essential workers into new 'construction' jobs to build out radiation resistant housing and reduce the risk of wildfires spreading into the city. This is either done via community efforts or government efforts. T2/1s start receiving a small influx of refugees fleeing fires, a conception that the city is safer, or fear that they wouldn't be able to escape their previous area of residence if things deteriorated (I.E. fire, chaos, or other). By day 7, the immigrants outweigh the emigrants. 

### Day 7-14
