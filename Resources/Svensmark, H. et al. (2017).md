the effect of ionization on the growth of aerosols into cloud condensation nuclei is investigated theoretically and experimentally. We show that the mass-flux of small ions can constitute an important addition to the growth caused by condensation of neutral molecules.

  
  

[[This is supported by correlation between times suspected of undergoing a near earth SN event and cooling periods, perhaps even causing an ice age. Cernâ€™s cloud experiment amongst many other studies have all previously pointed to ambiguous results.]]
