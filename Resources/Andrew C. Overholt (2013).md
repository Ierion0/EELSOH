Neutrons are formed through the process of cosmic ray spallation when high-energy particles collide with atmospheric nuclei. Neutrons penetrate much further into our atmosphere than the electromagnetic component as they are not geomagnetically trapped. As they propagate, they collidewith atmospheric nuclei, liberating additional particles aswell as slowing to thermal energies (~0.025 eV). Once atthermal speeds, these neutrons exhibit only random motiondue to their energy. These thermal neutrons are typically deposited in the stratosphere for lower energy primaries, with higher-energy primaries producing thermal neutrons closerto ground level (but still at altitude) as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Normalized cosmogenic neutron count per primary as a function of altitude above sea level. Neutron count is normalized by dividing by the total number of neutrons produced in each shower. The solid line represents a 10 GeV primary, with the dotted line representing 10 TeV primary and the dashed line representing 1 PeV primary. The present neutron distribution as measured by Goldhagen et al. [2004] is given as a dash-dotted line for comparison. The vertical lines correspond to commonly referenced altitudes: Denver, Colorado; Leadville, Colorado; and Mount Everest. High-energy primaries produce neutrons at lower altitudes (see Figure 2) due to their secondaries having energiessufficient for further secondary production.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/95Bhzx85a2JGVWS0IicEcG0jdVfR7Qy1it62Nagr-D600PhmUpBphL6-noCNsiMDevoyRBbA583hK4D0O3N_H0bCOC2qGKUYSiRN6QKvCdutQ6vH8nabO9vluGZRyxI4nEYORS3HRXoVKvUyX3xKTsh_esscEbytd7QmBtBeYnZW1jSGL7mFHjpEKMMviQ)
