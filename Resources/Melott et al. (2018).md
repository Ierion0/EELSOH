The type IIP … , are very weak in high-energy electromagnetic radiation

The recently confirmed event appears to have taken place inside the Local Bubble – so the cosmic rays will essentially be trapped by the walls of this bubble and reflected back by its intense magnetic field, causing the irradiation of the Earth to persist for a long time, perhaps hundreds of thousands of years. Therefore, we will emphasize steady-state effects.

…

The intense flux of cosmic rays at the Earth will have several effects. They strike the atmosphere, producing ‘showers’, as the high-energy particles produce other particles, all heading downward towards the Earth.

It takes 5–10 years for the NOx, as they are called, to be removed from the atmosphere, primarily by being rained out after a burst event. As this happens, it will provide an enhanced fertilizer for the nitrate-starved biota

  

The previously mentioned 25% depletion would produce about a 50% average increase in UVB at the surface

…

Marine phytoplankton productivity would be reduced, but the magnitude varies widely depending on species. For species commonly found in today’s Antarctic ocean, reductions of 5–20% can be expected … Damage to land plants could be increased by 10%–80%, again depending on species

…

Thomas (2017) concluded that UV damage is unlikely to cause widespread extinction but is likely to contribute to changes in ecosystem balances, with significant impact on some species with little negative (and possibly even positive) impact on others.

…

One of the elementary particles produced in abundance in air showers is muons …  They are extremely penetrating … they can have effects on biota as deep as a kilometre in water or several hundred metres underground … The signature of muon exposure, different from all other radiation loads, would be a bigger effect on large organisms … Neutrons are also produced in abundance, but they mostly do not reach the ground

Recent computations modelled for the first time the specific flux of muons on the ground expected from a moderately nearby supernova (Melott et al. 2017). The ground-level radiation dose from muons could easily rise by more than a factor of 150 from about 0.2 mSv per year to about 30 mSv per year (Melott et al. 2017) taking of order 10,000 years to return to normal from an event without assuming cosmic ray confinement in the Local Bubble. If there is confinement, this dose could last for 100,000 years. Although this dose sounds large, it is still only enough to increase the cancer risk for long-lived organisms by of order 5% per year of exposure. Mutation rates should be similarly affected.
