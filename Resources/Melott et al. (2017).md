we find that gamma-ray and X-ray fluxes are too small for substantial effects …  It seems that an SN IIP would have to be at about 5 pc [[16ly]] distance in order to have significant effects from these sorts of radiations …  (It may be worth noting that Gehrels et al. 2003 estimated a lethal distance of 8 pc, using only photons for the estimate.) [[ Gehrels: Summing our gamma-ray and cosmic ray depletions for DSN = 10 pc and taking into account that our adopted energy is larger than that found in the latest SN study mentioned earlier, we obtain a fiducial ‘‘ critical distance ’’ to significantly disrupt ozone of Dcrit ~= 8 pc for an SN with a total gamma-ray energy of ~1.8*10^47 ergs]]

In case A, we assume an intervening galactic magnetic field (GMF), with a regular plus turbulent component, and the regular component  lying along the line of sight to the supernova. Moreover, we assume in this case that the Earth and the SN are connected by a magnetic field line. In this way, we maximize the CR flux and obtain an upper bound on the possible impact of an SN at 50 pc distance on the life on Earth.

In case B, we assume that the supernova and the Earth both lie in the Local Bubble already excavated by previous supernova, with the regular component of the magnetic field swept away, and the turbulent field strongly reduced. Thus, only case B has parameters the same as Thomas et al. (2016), but the distance is halved.

The radiation dose is capable of producing damage to terrestrial biota; emphatically in case A. The radiation doses exceed the average worldwide radiation background dose from all sources (2.4 mSv yr−1 , UNSC 2008) for hundreds to thousands of years, and would be likely to cause increased cancer risk and mutations. The ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) models the risk of getting cancer increases by 5.5% for every 1 Sv of exposure.

A supernova would build up a dose of 1 Sv in a time period from about two years (in Case A), to about 30 years (in Case B). the change would also be more important in large organisms. Increasing the cancer risk of short-lived (<1 year) organisms by ∼5% and long-lived organisms by a larger factor could have detectable effects on the ecosystem as a whole.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/p4CKn-rY4cFXWBgCY_PKXU3r0ldJuvwJZPRJecuUrVRkZ_HcSgHdB6XXvtKHhW-9vlo3YetLgUnz1T91IMHNt-tucDIPCqoifY-TFLPiMfWTZSodHcED3lLLIfKF7DFguZ8vPc6myaPxBfG6jKe3WYRBryfDV5IBr74cEUlet5vvEQb0FGBUigfrcu4WDA)

The effect of neutrons is much less severe than muons. However, their high LET radiation does have the opportunity to produce more double strand DNA breaks, which can be the cause of more congenital malformations (Overholt et al. 2015).

Previous work in

this area has not considered tropospheric ionization, concentrating on stratospheric ionization, which ultimately depletes the ozone layer. Consequently, there has not been exploration of the consequences of such ionization. Effects should include increased lightning, a nitrogen fertilizer effect from nitrate rainout, and possibly cloud formation in the troposphere.
