We find that for the combined ozone depletion from these effects roughly to double the ‘‘ biologically active ’’ UV flux received at the surface of the Earth, the supernova must occur at <=8 pc [[26ly]]

…

Ozone is lost through a number of catalytic reactions involving several ‘‘ families ’’ or groups of constituents … These constituents have both natural and human-made sources, which are explained in several books (e.g., Dessler 2000).

We find that after 300 days of simulated gamma radiation input, the calculated changes in NOy and O3 column density depend significantly on iSN [[iSN is the angle]] … 

The largest increases in NOy for DSN = 10 pc [[32ly]]are for iSN +/- 90 and exceed 1800% over the poles… , with the zone of maximum decrease (60%) at 60 –70 latitude south for iSN = 90![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q4Z70BUDELQ51UgKJFBs3ph81semQ6McJYIfbu16JVQuSQATTMp78eiRG3LTS2BoGfg1RG11v-VYs5XMKzpC9kRta3UYOzg2yYrvF7z1JDDZMAoA4BdOKZPo76voObzFs7RB5smNAE6tY3Ru6ZqjkyOHNHfV2Ewqa-ztq2RtI0WYyg_5enNuiOiJSK29dw)

global ozone from gamma irradiation for 

DSN = 10 pc [[32ly]] as a function of iSN 

(average over year 2).

  
  
  

High production levels of NOy result in large selfdestruction of NOy and will somewhat limit the modeled concentrations of NOy 

…  

Ozone can be produced (rather than destroyed) by enhancements of NOy in the troposphere and in the lowest part of the tropical stratosphere 

…

Finally, the enhanced NOy begins to interfere with other families (...)  that destroy ozone, thus reducing the resultant ozone destruction

  

We take a factor of 2 increase in the biologically active UV flux to be a threshold for significant biological effects. This increase corresponds to an ozone depletion of 47%, given that the biologically active UV flux scales roughly as the reciprocal of the ozone column (Madronich et al. 1998) …  Summing our gamma-ray and cosmicray depletions for DSN = 10 pc [[32ly]], we obtain a fiducial ‘‘ critical distance ’’ to significantly disrupt ozone of Dcrit = 8 pc [[26ly]] for an SN with a total gamma-ray energy of ~1.8*10^47 ergs

  

The impulsive addition of energy into the atmosphere by other types of catastrophes may also lead to the production of NOy; therefore, the accompanying destruction of ozone may not be unique … through a sudden event would probably be less long lasting.
