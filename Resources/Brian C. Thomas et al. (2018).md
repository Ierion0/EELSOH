[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962913/figure/f5/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962913/figure/f5/) Figure 5 presents the ratio of PAR. Values are larger everywhere in the SN case due to reduced absorption by O3. The change here is larger than for UVA but still quite small compared to UVB. An increase in PAR may be expected to lead to greater photosynthesis rates. Here the largest increase in PAR is at high latitudes, which could provide some benefit to plants that normally have short growing seasons with lower irradiance available. This again may offset the increase in damage from UVB.

  

Ratio of surface-level UVB irradiance in the 300 yr SN case compared to control run, as a function of time, at latitudes between 5° and 55° north. Time 0 indicates an arbitrary reference time after steady state is achieved![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVi6Ipt5etUReqUyATo2goiQoS4Xh0t39e4bwUKi_3SFov3Fz3jN70abH4GLpwv_zf7UzUI3pQly9LVaRiEEBjNwJ9FJp57myE3yNCi4AZqAswNhWbqKSANn7j43W9UimZyGkh5yqyYrkpj4uiJesnfY0EbiNfLo33Y5e0HorXVGYSDGHff2FzmDWvXqrw)

  

This would first shower the earth in massive radiation, strip the ozone layer ([2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/346127/meta)), and cause massive temperary global warming ([1](https://sites.google.com/view/sources-supernovadeath); use [3](http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/equiltemp.html)).

It might be expected that UVB and (for instance) DNA damage changes would track exactly, but they clearly do not at the higher latitudes. This mismatch is caused by the fact that “UVB” is a broad-band integrated value, while DNA damage (as well as our other results) is a convolution of spectral irradiance and the (spectral) BWF; therefore, differences in exactly which wavelengths are affected by changes in atmospheric chemistry impact the subsequent biological effects.
