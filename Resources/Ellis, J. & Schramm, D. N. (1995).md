Recent studies, motivated by the appearance of the ozone depletionin the Antarctic, indicate that the increase in ultra violet radiation due to ozone removal could have negative effect on phytoplankton, and hence on the rest of marine life, from zooplankton through to benthic life… We also note that a shutdown of photosynthesis due to ultraviolet irradiation could well be followed by a greenhouse episode.
