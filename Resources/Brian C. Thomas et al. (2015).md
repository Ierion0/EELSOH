We limited our modeling to clear-sky conditions (no clouds) and fixed aerosol parameter values. 

// *Note that increase cloud cover may occur

…

Figure 2 shows the globally averaged percent difference in column density O3 over 10 years following the event. Note that full recovery takes just over 10 years, and globally averaged depletion greater than 20% persists for just over 4 years

…

The maximum localized decrease in total vertical column density of O3 for this case is about 70%, and the maximum globally averaged decrease in total vertical column density is about 32%

…

While we focus here on one particular kind of radiation event, our results will be applicable to a wide range of events

…

Finally, in the GRB case PAR is initially lower and then becomes higher. This change in PAR is due to a competition between increased NO2 column density and decreased O3 column density. NO2 absorbs in the short wavelength (approximately 400-500 nm) end of the PAR region, while O3 has an absorption band centered around 600 nm and extending across most of the PAR region

…

these results appear to make a global (or even regional) cooling episode much less likely than was previously assumed.

… 

Note that there is more than a 5-fold increase compared to a normal background level, across most of the latitude range of interest … Previous work in which this BWF was used presented results in terms of values normalized by the annual global average under normal atmospheric conditions; we present a similar result for this work in the middle panel of Figure 8 … Moreover, even this value is a conservative maximum since it was calculated at noon for clear sky conditions … Interestingly, irradiance weighted non-melanoma skin cancer shows only a modest increase, less than a factor of 2 at maximum

…

Our surface-level irradiance results also have implications for suggestions in past work (Melott et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2010) that the climate could cool following the production of NO2 and accompanying reduction in visible light. That work neglected the compensating effect of reduced O3, which actually leads to a net increase in visible light (PAR) over the long term. Importantly, our results also show that significant effects can occur at all levels of organism-complexity; humans, higher plants, and phytoplankton all show a significant increase in damage following O3 depletion

…

We are aware of two studies that sought to evaluate the potential ecosystem impact of major ozone depletion events. Martin et al. (2010) considered phytoplankton mortality following an increase of surface-level UV irradiance and used the Comprehensive Aquatic Simulation Model (Amemiya et al., 2007) to study the impact on a lake ecosystem. This study is limited, however, by uncertainties and relative lack of data on the mortality caused by increased UV. In addition, changes in PAR are not considered. A complication recognized by Martin et al. (2010) is that the recovery of the atmosphere following an ionization event involves deposition of nitrate. While there is some possibility for stress caused by acidification, Melott et al. (2005) and Thomas and Honeyman (2008) showed that the most likely result is actually an increase in primary productivity due to the nitrate acting as a “fertilizer.” This complication has not been included in any attempts to model ecosystem impacts.

…

Overall, our results confirm that major biological impacts would be associated

with severe O3 depletion
