The theory of lightning initiation is not well-developed, and we

cannot say that a 50-fold increase in ionization would lead to a 50-fold increase in the

number of lightning events. However, the potential is there for a large increase. … in the supernova-enhanced regime, there would be of order hundreds of highenergy primaries per km2 per second, so that ionization would be intermediate between continuous and pulsed. 

…

A large increase in lightning would again be expected to cause a large increase in the number of wildfires started.

…

Our computations suggested that the increase in available nitrogen would be relatively small, of order 10% from the cosmic ray ionization. However, a large increase in the rate of lighting could provide a strong enhancement in the deposition of nitrate.

…

This might lead, as discussed in Melott et al. (2019b, above) to a CO2 drawdown and cooling of the climate
