Shielding from radiation is imperative. Shielding from UVB can be done via going moderately underground, but muon radiation and secondarily neutron radiation needs to be shielded from. Magnetic shielding may slow down muons from relativistic speeds, causing them to decay. However, this would really just shift the envelope into higher energies. However, physical shielding (and perhaps magnetic shielding) may cause more radiation because the shielding may cause the muons to create radioactive isotopes that emit more interactive radiation. From Wikipedia: Absorption cross section is often highly dependent on neutron energy. In general, the likelihood of absorption is proportional to the time the neutron is in the vicinity of the nucleus. The time spent in the vicinity of the nucleus is inversely proportional to the relative velocity between the neutron and nucleus. Janis has an interactive website that shows the cross section for most common isotopes relative to neutron speeds. XCOM from NIST has photon cross section data for different energy levels for elements. 

Studying these papers (primarily [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962913/), ), then the impact on the ecosystem would seem to be very negative especially for the first weeks or months where the earth would heat up between 5 (16ly) ) - 22 (6ly) Celsius and potential lightning storms cause wildfires as UVB radiation increases. There may be up to a 66% reduction in the ozone layer from gamma and cosmic rays, depending on latitude (figures below to show relative impact).

The best thing to do would be to run my own calculations with these models, but it is improbable that I have the computing power, especially considering my ram capacity.

  

I will use “Solar Irradiance Changes and Photobiological Effects at Earth's Surface Following Astrophysical Ionizing Radiation Events” as a basis for the radiation effects of the supernova. The biggest problem is that this is based on a gamma-ray burst, however the effects that are taken into account are from depletion of O3 rather than direct effects from gamma-ray bursts, however it is possible that atmospheric cascades were calculated, however it was not mentioned. It is more probable not due to speed of GRBs on the large timescales considered. O3 depletion and NX increases are more in line with a very close super-nova, at least short-term. I will not be considering rate of atmospheric recovery, but it doesn’t seem like their data is either (as that is not their timeframe). An additional complicating variable is the inclusion of muon and neutron radiation. It also seems that a many studies neglect the serious effects of nuetron and muon radiation. At 50pc, 2017 melott et al calculated (for the more probable case) ~.449mSv per year. Extremely crude calculations would mean at 44.9mSv@5pc and 280mSv@2pc at 100yrs. Even worse calculations estimate 61mSv and 382mSv at 1-10yr (extrapolating a curve based on fall-off). It would seem that it would take [~30 months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962913/figure/f2/) for ozone depletion to kick in. However, considering that “Case A” has such a higher effect, it’s hard to determine what values are taken into consideration when assessing other papers.

  

I would assume that at the beginning of the SN, cosmic rays would be blasting only one side of earth (at a time). The cosmic rays will slowly affect the earth irrespective of angle to the SN due to CR dispersion. This wouldn’t change much in terms of ozone depletion as it takes a long time to kick in, but it has substantial effects for muon and neutron radiation. Cancer rates are estimated at +5.5%/mSv. It is painfully unclear at what exact timescale this means because the wording is often ~“increased chance of getting cancer from the radiation”, however, if someone were 18yr/o and lived till 120, their chance should be drastically different than someone at 80 living till 87. From my research ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635397/)), we can start at a 20yo male, where the chance is 8%, and then for every 20 years divide by 2. For a female starting at 20yo, the chance is 12%, and for every 20 years divide by 2. These numbers can then be augmented by normal cancer rates by chance of cancer per age group.

I had no good numbers, so I had to extrapolate them from this graph. For 0-500, 25/6 per pixel, for 500-2500, 500+ 250/61 * (pixels - 120).![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IZPcCBHje5reXMiLGyEj7a32-Li1kUvRhLv4RSnVCx9X2GQsCyCdzZXHtzCxmQbZnL2ALcJudrolaS2-8_Lw_xRAhL5TDi2jmIH5bn-kcxfqYGN_H0HLro7J_E0yEd92KYV_dDd6Q-5ptv5USPHQk-tzhEUa4LFK9Oo6On8WZsXFM6f5qFDOhQ8SH9bn9A)

Ages under 20 will be affected by cancer rates much more drasically and via different mechanisms, so that will be a different calculation all together. And don’t misconstrue the precision as accuracy (significant figures here aren’t signifying accuracy or confidence).

This equation is an approximated growth curve of the chance of cancer over a 5 year period given Sv, base change for the sex at 20yo, and age.

  

However, it may be more likely that the more radiation, the lesser the slope of the curve.

This is a curve that approximates the cancer rate until ~75-79 range, where the ‘top end’ of the growth curve would be. Then it follows the same approximate slope. w is how much the graph is slid over, and a more complex formula would have to be made to determine the weight, but it wouldn’t be hard to create. f is a random number meaning nothing. The square root is to represent the derivative that increases slowly, then levels off – which is what I believed made the most sense in this case and would fit the exponential part of the growth curve. The integral starts at 20 as the age estimates start at 20, and the ` - 205.2 ` is to start the curve at 0. The curve starting 20 f in is optimal, so I didn’t change that. The `.0..2` is just a coefficient, and constant 40 is the starting point for 20yo.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SftJAanXf4OnKnIHun9Rs2XSvuHzuA-bBC_WmCQxIR6ru30s8Ow2BE17nau5XqYIv9m5FCwPoEluOBQb5SdTrHIXwuhCHWVDoAzk-dFbWOljHBH914_RW93jsgbj4_k2TQ4ELgMUphCYdo_pZvdxCh2OgAklkLN8MzwqpWyvabBSc-cslMydrnJaxERjeA)

  

Using the growth curve equation, in the worst case scenario of 500mSv/a for a woman starting at 20yo, 0.16% in 20s (0.16), 0.6% in her 30s (.76), 2.4% in her 40s (3.1), 8.4% in her 50s (11.3), 21.1% in her 60s (30), and 36.4% in her 70s (55.5). If required, this equation can reverse engineer desired values for societal and biological outcomes. It should also be noted these cancers will still take time to progress, but will probably occur in organs. 

  

Some places may have higher amounts of radiation, especially in cities, where neutron and muon radiation may create hotspots of radioactive isotopes. Atomic composition, [half-lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclides) (and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_nuclides_by_half-life#100_seconds)), and capture ratios have to be considered when calculating these values. For lower half-times, they will create consistent higher radiation very soon after capture. For longer half-times, they will approach the amount of radiation that they capture. This will occur because it allows muons and neutrons to collide with these elements, which will in turn emit radiation. This will give radiation another chance of hitting a human, and the radiation will be much more likely to strike something quickly. The radiation could also hit another element again and again, but the effects diminish quite quickly. Radiation contamination of the food chain could also occur. 58Fe -> 59Fe, 54Fe -> 55Fe, 30Si -> 31Si, 15N -> 16N, 24Na -> 25Na, 35Cl -> 36Cl,  (18O-> )(17O-> )18O -> 19O, (1H->) 2H-> 3H, 44Ca->45Ca, 46Ca-> 47Ca. There is more, and degree to which these will emit radiation will very based on additional factors. None of these isotopes are the common versions of them, only ~%6 of iron (which is one of the highest, if not the highest) will directly go into a radioactive form; 92% of iron (55Fe) would have to gain 3 neutrons for instance. The effect of radioactive isotopes would be more pronounced for the radiation observed than other types of radiation because capture is the primary limiter of radiation exposure. Here are some normal cross sections for the pertinent elements ([1](https://www.oecd-nea.org/janis/book/book-neutron-2020-09.pdf)) (I did the molar mass wrong; forgot to use the isotope specific. Additionally, density changes.): 54Fe 4.44b (31.41% capture / cm), 58Fe 8.86b (52.87% capture / cm), 30Si 2.61 (12.20% / cm), 44Ca 4.25 (8.61% / cm), 46Ca 3.71 (7.24% /cm), and for applicable isotopes in nylon66: 2.5522% from 15N & 1.7111% from oxygen (total: 4.26%). From my own estimates, iron seems to be the most likely to be irradiated. The most probable outcome would be that iron would be the most irradiated, with the first cm (due to 56Fe blocking neutrons) would be the most reactive. Due to effective 54Fe density, effective capture rate would be more like 2.23%. Using 1. 100ergs = 0.01Sv, 2. Neutron flux of 52, 3. All energy that passes through is absorbed by the human, 4. 2.23% capture, 5. at 35x170cm, at 64kg, and at average distance from irradiated iron at 1m: there needs to be 1000m$^2$x1cm of iron for an increase of 100mSv. All in all, there seems to be little indication that there would be much irradiation from neutron flux.

As human cm2 increases, kg decreases, atmospheric density decreases, isotope density increases, distance decreases, and surface area : depth increases, then Sv increases. 

Another interesting note is that nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere would absorb a very large amount of neutrons when they become thermal. $^{15}$N = 0.035%,  $^{14}$N = 23.0798%, O $\approx$ 1.975% (.0005% capture from $^{19}$O) @ 5m. This is $\approx$ 25% absorption after 5 meters. $^{16}$N and $^{19}$O have very short half lives.  0.2007589 mSv/yr/cm$^3$. However, considering the composition of the human, there is almost 100% chance of gamma ray capture, whereas the atmosphere has ~0.2%/cm.
Using `\frac{2\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{170}{x}\right)\cdot\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{35}{x}\right)\right)}{\pi^{2}}`, Sv increases by 16.35 mSv/yr from the atmosphere.

Using the same idea, a lot of radioactive isotopes within an open space is still damaging, as expected.

From my analysis of radiation levels of common compounds, it appears that cities should have something like 2x the normal radiation levels (200mSv vs 100mSv). Concrete seems to be the most dangerous. This combined with iron indicates that buildings would be pretty irradiated, and the interior would be dangerous. Aluminum is the most worrying element, with >99% of the natural aluminum being an isotope that results in radioactivity at +1 neutron. The decay results in 4.642182414 MeV via beta decay. It may be that one can produces 770 mSv per year. Cars also have a large percentage of aluminum. At a half life of 2 minutes, however, it can be waited out if required. 

Corresponding UVB levels would be far higher, requiring polarized sun glasses (UVB & UVA) and protective clothing. Sun burns would increase by 3x, skin cancer by 7x, cataracts by 1.4x, and DNA damage by 7x without protective clothing. Muon and Neutron radiation would be around 100mSv, and the radioactive atmosphere would be ~+16mSv, and ~$\frac{86}{\text{weight of mass}}mSv$ directly to the lungs through breathing. The only way of mitigating the damage to the lungs is via "weighting out" it's radiation, N and O has a half life of few seconds. A long tube made out of a material with high neutron capture should mitigate the damage. Additionally, radioactive particulates could make their way into the lungs. This could be mitigated by simple, cheap filtration. Neutron flux would have to be mitigated though neutron shielding. Muon flux would be hard to mitigate, but it would also decrease from shielding. 

It is possible due to nitrogen deposition, radiation increase, and decomposing/weakened biomass that there will be an explosion in fungi growth.

Computers without ECC will basically be unusable, while even computers with ECC will have trouble. Neutrons will increase by ~400x to maybe 51 bit flips per on-day per GB of ram. This is probably also applicable to SSDs.

Food irradiation could improve the lifespan of foods



From my estimations, water wouldn't be that radioactive.
